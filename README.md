# Wait, what? Getting your bearings with ServerSpec
## Afternoon Workshop, UCDLFx19, Monday May 20, 2019 San Diego, CA

  Abstract: Library developers change jobs, we’re always the newbie.
  [ServerSpec](https://serverspec.org/) is a fantastic tool for keeping track of
  exactly what is supposed to be running on which server. Chances are such tests
  don’t exist in your current workplace; chances are such tests would be
  significantly helpful to your coworkers. This is a tool that should be in
  your box.

  The two "live demo" portions in the introduction are recorded and edited Asciinema screencasts.

  * Demo 1: https://asciinema.org/a/LrkbHUBGBsd0NuR3ZVPkc6bC3
  * Demo 2: https://asciinema.org/a/0lKzSKyfu9CJpoAa2Nq1CZkIZ

  To play these slides requires [Reveal-md](https://github.com/webpro/reveal-md), which
  can be installed with a simple `npm install -g reveal-md` command, if you have
  npm and Node.js installed. In order to edit these slides, you can run the
  following command:

  `reveal-md ucdlfx19-serverspec-workshop.md --watch`

  To print these slides, run the following:

  `reveal-md --print ucdlfx19-serverspec-workshop.pdf ucdlfx19-serverspec-workshop.md`

  Or, if you just want to view the slides, a PDF of them will eventually be place here:
  [PDF](ucdlfx19-serverspec-workshop.pdf). However, this workshp is currently being
  drafted right now, so, for a quick preview of the content of the slides, you
  can just glance at the [markdown file](ucldfx19-serverspec-workshop.md).
